## Introduction

Lucid is currently in an embryonic state but we wish to achieve a fast, secure and distributed key-value store accessible through an HTTP API, we also want to propose persistence, encryption, WebSocket streaming, replication and a lot of features.

## Getting Started

```bash
$ curl https://github.com/lucid-kv/lucid/releases/download/0.1.2/lucid.exe
$ ./lucid init   #Initialize the Lucid node
$ ./lucid server
```

A demonstration instance (with auth. disabled) is accessible at http://lucid-kv.herokuapp.com.

## Documentation

You can find the official documentation at https://docs.lucid-kv.store.

## Some Use Cases

- Private Keys Storing (for a wallet by example)
- IoT: collect and save statistics data
- A distributed cache for an application
- Service Discovery
- Distributed Configuration
- Blob Storage

## Command Line Interface

## Web Interface (UI)

Lucid wants to propose a web UI to manage data, issue tokens, organize nodes and configure instances.
